<h3> Week 3</h3>
<p>
    This week I worked on JQuery experiments. I have picked up theme of cuisine this week. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/JQuery/JQuery01.html" target="_blank"><u>First Experiment</u></a>, I have shown 4 cuisines and all of them are draggable on the page. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/JQuery/JQuery02.html" target="_blank"><u>Second Experiment</u></a>,I am showing the the details of a particular cusisine if any user clicks on any of the cuisines. In my  <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/JQuery/JQuery03.html" target="_blank"><u>Third Experiment</u></a>, the user can edit the details of the cuisines.In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/JQuery/JQuery04.html" target="_blank"><u>Fourth Experiment</u></a>, user can add additional cuisines and some details about it. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/JQuery/JQuery05.html" target="_blank"><u>Fifth Experiment</u></a>, user is shown a menu and if user hovers above any of the menu then related picture is shown.

<h3> Week 4</h3>
<p>
    This week I worked on JQuery AJAX and angular experiments. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/ajax/JQueryAjax01.html" target="_blank"><u>First Experiment</u></a>, I have used a ajax call to display data on UI. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/ajax/JQueryAjax02.html" target="_blank"><u>Second Experiment</u></a>,I have displayed a drop down on UI that will display the required data. In my  <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/angular/angular01.html" target="_blank"><u>Third Experiment</u></a>, I am using a Angular framework. I have used a static data that is displayed. Here I learnt how model and controller are linked to each other. if I change one then the change is reflected in other .In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/angular/angular02.html" target="_blank"><u>Fourth Experiment</u></a>, I have used a API call using Angular and data is shown.In addition functionalities like add/remove are addeed. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/angular/angular03.html" target="_blank"><u>Fifth Experiment</u></a>, extending previous experiment I added the functionality of making a item as favourite.

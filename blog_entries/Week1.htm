<h3>Week 1</h3>

<p>In Week 1 I experimented on HTML and CSS. I learnt about using basic HTML tags, internal styles, inline styles and external style sheets.I was able 
    to create a grid using style sheets without requiring any table.  In my last
     experiment I used &lt;map&gt; tag. Here I can create a relationship between an image and map and hence user can click on a page 
    and will be proceeded to assigned url. The source code for all the pages is available on the web site. </p>

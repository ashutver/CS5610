<h3> Week 2</h3>
<p>
    This week I worked on Responsive design. Using @media query I am trying to adjust the components on screen according to given screen size. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/responsive/Responsive02.html" target="_blank"><u>First Experiment</u></a>, I am working on Responsive text. here 2 sections are there and initially they are placed horizontally but on smaller screens they will be placed vertically. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/responsive/Responsive03.html" target="_blank"><u>Second Experiment</u></a> I have worked on Responsive Menu, Which is stretched in horizontally for wider screens but for smaller screens like mobile screens, this tabular form is replaced by a single menu. once you click on it it takes user to bottom where the links are displaced horizontally. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/responsive/Responsive04.html" target="_blank"><u>Third Experiment</u></a>, I have worked on Responsive image.Here the image adjusts to the given screens like dektops, tablets or mobile phones. As the width of the screen decreases the image is resized to fit in the window.In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/responsive/Responsive05.html" target="_blank"><u>Fourth Experiment</u></a>, here I worked on Responsive Table. In bigger screens table can be well placed but in samaller screens it is very difficult to present a table in tabular form so for smaller screens, using CSS, I am showing data in form of sheets.In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/responsive/Responsive06.html" target="_blank"><u>Fifth Experiment</u></a>, I have used Bootstrap instead of @media query to make the screen responsive. Here I am creating a grid which displays the elements grid elements in block shape once the screen size is decreased.

<h3> Week 5</h3>
<p>
    This week I worked on Angular experiments using routing framework. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/angular/angular04.html" target="_blank"><u>First Experiment</u></a>, I am using nav bar displaying menus and user can navigate to any of them. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/angular/angular05.html" target="_blank"><u>Second Experiment</u></a>,I am implementing the log in functionality. In my  <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/angular/angular06.html" target="_blank"><u>Third Experiment</u></a>, I am implementing the log out functionality. Here I learnt to use the log in features. I learnt how to display profile menu option once the user logs in and how to replace the login button with log out button and set the current user in scope. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/angular/angular07.html" target="_blank"><u>Fourth Experiment</u></a>, I worked on profile page, here user view his complete profile. In my <a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/ashutver/Experiments/angular/angular08.html" target="_blank"><u>Fifth Experiment</u></a>, user can view his profile and also can add/drop courses according to his role.

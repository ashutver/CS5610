        <hr />
       <p>
           Fitness Plus is my project under the course Web Developemnt (CS-5610) that I took during my graduation.
           I have created a applciation on fitness. User can look at different exercises and create his workout. Basically
            people can find all information related to fitness whether it is about muscles or equipment or nutrition.
           <br/>
          I have used following api for my project:  <a href=" http://wger.de/api/v2/"> Wger api</a>

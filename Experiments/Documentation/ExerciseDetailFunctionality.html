        <h1>Exercise Detail Functionality</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
           Exercise Details page displays all details about the clicked exercise. It displays the equipment used, description for exercise, images and
            body muscles involved in given exercises.
          
           Here I have added user commenting. user after login can comment on an exercise. All other users can view the comments. User's comments 
            will be displayed along with user name which would be a link and if user clicks on this link then it would lead to user profile page.

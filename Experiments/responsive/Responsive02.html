                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h4> About the experiment</h4>

        <p>
            With a @media query, you can write different CSS code for different media types.

            This helps when you want different layout for different media types such as a screen or a printer, but also when you want different layout for different devices, which is very useful when making web pages with responsive design.

            You can also have different layout when a user resizes the browser window up or down to a certain width, or height. Here I used 3 media tags where first one is for desktop, where 2 section are placed horizontally. Next one is used for tablet, here also sections are arranged horizontally. Next one is for mobile. here input label and textbox will be placed vertically and sections will also be placed vertically.
